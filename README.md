Welcome to the repo for my 41099 Introduction to Mechatronics Engineering Assessment 4 project, 
which is an Arduino based ground station designed to communicate with a cardboard box that will 
act as a "satellite" via IR.

<b> Project Description </b>

A ground station designed to locate and communicate with a satellite, which is a cardboard box 
with sensors and a transceiver. The system has a user input interface to send commands to the 
satellite, an actuation subsystem that allows for rotation and directional tracking of the 
satellite, and an output system to show live data readings from the satellite. The satellite 
will be moved around the ground station, and the ground station will have to actively find and 
maintain a direct line of sight with the satellite in order to establish and maintain 
communications.
