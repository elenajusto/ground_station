# ground_station

<b> Project Description </b>

A ground station designed to locate and communicate with a satellite, which is a cardboard box 
with sensors and a transceiver. The system has a user input interface to send commands to the 
satellite, an actuation subsystem that allows for rotation and directional tracking of the 
satellite, and an output system to show live data readings from the satellite. The satellite 
will be moved around the ground station, and the ground station will have to actively find and 
maintain a direct line of sight with the satellite in order to establish and maintain 
communications.

# Video Demonstrations

<b>First Operational Prototype</b>

This is the first operational prototype of the ground station where the tower has been mounted
onto the platform and is able to use both motors for 180 by 180 degree actuation.

<b>Latest Prototype</b>

Demonstrating whole sky scanning capability (does not have actual tranceivers operating, this is 
just a demonstration of theactuation process for scanning).
